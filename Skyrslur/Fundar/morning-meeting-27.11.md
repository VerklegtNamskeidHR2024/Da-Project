## Morning Meeting 27.11
Morning Meeting, Day 3 

We started the morning meeting by reviewing how breaks should be structured, as on Day 2 the breaks had become rather long, and we wanted to manage them better to keep track of our time. 

Next, we discussed ways to improve our report to better document our changes and then went over how we are allowed to change some requirements. 

Next, we went over and caught the group up with what we learned from the T.A.s the day before to get everyone up to speed, next was the class diagram and we went over how they worked. 

Next, we planned our goals for the day and assigned loose tasks for everyone to work on over the day.
