## Progress of the day
\Today we fixed all of the use cases and the class diagram based on the feedback we got from the teacher in the morning. After having fixed everything we started to plan some part of the programming out and set up all of the classes and many of the functions we will be using during the project. We started a little with the storage and UI layers of the program at the end of the day and decided to use json as our storage files and set up the files we will be using during the project and the main menu scene is ready in the UI.\
