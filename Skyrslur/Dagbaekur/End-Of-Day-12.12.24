Jón:\ Today I started by checking the entire system for errors and inaccuracies. I found a lot of errors with diffrent scenes and wrote them all down and fixed a few and told the group about what needed to be fixed. After that we started adding the clear screen functions in all of the codes while adding some color to error messages and doing some minor tweaks. I arrived at 11:00 and left at 3:00\
