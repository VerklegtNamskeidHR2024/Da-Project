Kormákur:\
I worked mainly on creating a fully functional quit and back feature for the properties UI menu, so the user can go back or turn of the system at any point. Made it possible to create an amenity in properties as well as creating a "Enter Staff ID" fuction so that it can verify the user priveledges and filter the data they receive while in the sub-menus. Also worked on refining the code layout of both the properties and work requests UI menu. Lastly I typehinted for most of the functions in properties UI/Logic, work request UI/Logic and the logic/storage layer wrappers. Only issues I faced was when creating amenities and verifying the staff Id during the log-in, however those issues have been fixed. Came at 10:30 and left at 22:30, continued working on fixing any issues I encountered while testing the stuff I worked on today when I came home for about 2 hours. 


Jón:\ Today I created a list of all requirements that were yet to be finished and had the morning meeting were we decided we wanted to try to finish the majority today. We are still missing a 2-3 A requirements and 2 B requirements. With the B requirements we are considering to not implement them if we wont have time but have not fully decided on that. After the morning meeting I went to format the document for the project fixing the overall look of it. Later in the day I fixed the contractor UI layer when viewing information and work requests about contractors. Tumi had alredy put most of it into code and I implemented it.\
